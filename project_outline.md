DevOps Collaboration Project: Automated Web Server Deployment

Project Summary
	This project successfully demonstrates the automation of a web server infrastructure using a modern DevOps workflow. I provisioned a Linux VM and used Ansible to automate the installation of the Docker environment.
	A custom Docker image was built to serve a professionally styled web page, and the entire lifecycle was managed through a collaborative Git workflow.
Final Deployment Status
	Status: Successfully deployed.
	Infrastructure: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS managed via Ansible.
	Containerization: Docker container running an nginx-based web server.
	Web Content: Successfully updated with "Student B" verification.
Repo Information
	GitHub Repository URL: https://github.com/malaknagui-crypto/devops-web-project
Collaboration Notes
	The Git workflow was successgully executed, demonstrating proper branching, pulling and merging between "Student A" and "Student B" roles.
Lessons Learned
	Automation: Ansible significantly reduces manual configuration errors when setting up Docker.
	Version Control: Frequent commits and descriptive messages are essential for tracking collaboration.
	CI/CD: Using GitHub Actions ensured that the Docker image was built correctly before deployment.
